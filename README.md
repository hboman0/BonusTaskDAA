1. INTRODUCTION

This project implements a fundamental string-processing data structure: the Suffix Array (SA), along with its companion structure, the Longest Common Prefix Array (LCP) using Kasai’s algorithm. These data structures are widely used in pattern matching, compression algorithms, string comparison, text indexing, genome sequence processing, and many other computational tasks.


2. ALGORITHM

The suffix array (SA) is an array of integer indices where each entry represents the starting position of a suffix in the string, arranged so that all suffixes appear in lexicographically sorted order. In this project, the SA was constructed using the prefix-doubling method, which begins by assigning each character a rank based on its ASCII value and then repeatedly sorting suffixes using rank pairs that represent the first k characters and the next k characters, doubling k in each iteration until all suffixes receive unique ranks. This approach is straightforward to implement and sufficiently efficient for the assignment.

To complement the SA, the longest common prefix (LCP) array was computed using Kasai’s algorithm. The LCP array records the length of the common prefix between each pair of adjacent suffixes in the suffix array. Kasai’s method achieves linear time by constructing an inverse suffix array, scanning the string from left to right, and reusing previously computed prefix lengths to avoid unnecessary comparisons. This makes it possible to compute all LCP values efficiently without recalculating prefix matches from scratch.
LCP[i] = LCP( suffix[SA[i]], suffix[SA[i−1]] )

3. TEST CASES AND OUTPUT

Three test strings were chosen, following assignment requirements:

Short string: "ananas"

Medium string: "designandanalytucs"

Longer string: "ineedmyscholarshippleasemakefinalseasy"

The output produced by the program consists of several components for each test string. First, the program prints a header indicating which string is currently being tested. After that, it displays a table containing the index within the suffix array, the corresponding suffix array value (SA), the longest common prefix value (LCP), and the actual suffix beginning at that index in the original string. This table effectively shows the suffixes in lexicographically sorted order. The LCP values shown alongside them represent the lengths of the common prefixes between each adjacent pair of sorted suffixes. Once the table is printed and all data for the test case has been shown, the program concludes with the standard termination message generated by the Java runtime, confirming that the execution completed successfully.

4. TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
   Suffix Array Construction

Using prefix-doubling with comparison-based sorting:

Sorting each step: O(n log n)

Number of steps: O(log n)

Total time: O(n log² n)

Space usage:

Space: O(n)


LCP Array (Kasai)

Kasai’s algorithm is linear:

Space: O(n) (LCP and rank arrays)

Total Complexity

Time: O(n log² n)

Space: O(n)

5. CONCLUSION

The Suffix Array and LCP were successfully implemented in Java using prefix-doubling and Kasai’s algorithm. The code correctly processes short, medium, and long strings, producing accurate suffix and LCP arrays. The project demonstrates effective use of string indexing techniques and provides a solid foundation for more advanced algorithms in text processing and pattern matching.
